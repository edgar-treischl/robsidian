You can install the development version of robsidian from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("edgar-treischl/robsidian")
```

## Example

In order to use the package, you need to set the environment variable `robsidian_dir` to the path of your Obsidian vault. This can be done with the following code:

```{r example}
library(robsidian)
Sys.setenv(robsidian_dir = "~/Documents/GitHub/documentation")

```

The package provide the Obsidian preview app as R Studio addin. You can use it to preview the current R Markdown document in Obsidian.
